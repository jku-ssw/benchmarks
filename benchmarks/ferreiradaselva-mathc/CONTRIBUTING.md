- At least until the version 2.0.0, the structure `vec` will remain as the structure for 2D vectors, 3D vectors and quaternions.
- At least until the version 2.0.0, there will be only 4x4 matrices.
- The orientation is right-handed for OpenGL compatibility. Focus on compatibility with other API is not of interest.
- The library will remain licensed under ZLIB.

## Contributions of interest
